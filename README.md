# scalaspark
Repo for learning scala and spark.

I used the Almond scala kernel (https://almond.sh/docs/try-docker) for Jupyter Notebooks from the docker image 
almondsh/almond:0.8.2-scala-2.12.8

The exercises are based around those in the excellent O'Reilly book: Advanced Analytics with Spark, Patterns for Learning from Data at Scale 2nd Edition â€“ Sandy Ryza, Uri Laserson, Sean Owen, Josh Wills (2017)

The book provides a repo for the code that was written using earlier versions of Scala and Spark but which is best suited to running in an  IDE. However, the interactive analysis experience of Jupyter notebooks greatly increases the easy of experimentation and so I've upgraded and implemented the code to run in the Almond kernel with Scala 2.12.8 for Jupyter that is built on the Ammonite Scala REPL. This kernel offers excellent support of Spark.

At the time of work on these exercises, Netflix also opensourced Polynote which is allows Scala and Python to be used in the same notebook.
